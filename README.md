## Installation

Clone or download the project from this git repository.

**Setup** the recommended database through the following mySQL commands:
```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS banking;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS banking_test;

CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'ironhacker'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '1r0nh4ck3r';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON banking.* TO 'ironhacker'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON banking_test.* TO 'ironhacker'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

To run the application:
    - Open the repository as a project in a IDE;
    - Run the main application "BankingApplication.java", on the path:
      `./src/main/java/com/ironhack/midtermProject/BankingApplication.java`
    - Run the tests present in the tests' path:
      `./src/test/java`

It is also possible to change the properties in the application.properties file to a custom user and database. However, the tests
properties are defined in each test.

## Users

This banking application includes three types of Users: Administrator, Account Holder and Third Party.

### Administrator (Admin)

The Admin has the permission to:
- Create new banking accounts,
- Change the balance of existing accounts,
- Access banking accounts information,
- Add Third Party users.

### Account Holder

An Account Holder is a banking client and can own or co-own multiple banking accounts. 
The Account Holder has the permission to:
- Access his accounts informations (both owned or co-owned),
- Do transactions from his accounts.

### Third Party

The Third Party has the permission to:
- Make transactions with banking accounts when providing his own hashed key.

## Banking Accounts

There are currently 4 diferent types of Banking Accounts, which are Savings, Credit Card, Checking and Student Checking.
All accounts have some common functionalities and properties:
-  All accounts have a unique identifier with a prefix, identifying which type of account the id belongs to:
    -  ```CC_#``` for Credit Card accounts,
    -  ```SA_#``` for Savings accounts,
    -  ```CH_#``` for Checking accounts,
    -  ```SC_#``` for Student Checking accounts.
- Accounts can be frozen when a possible fraud is detected,
- When a account is frozen it can not do any transaction to other accounts,
- All accounts have a default penalty fee value of 40€,
- All accounts have a primary owner (Account Holder user) and may have a secondary owner.

### Savings

Apart from the common account functionalities Savings accounts also have:
- A minimum balance:
    - If the account balance reaches a lower value the penalty fee is applied
- An interest rate applied yearly through the equation:
    - ```newBalance = oldBalance * (1 + interestRate)```
- Transactions that would lead to a negative balance are not allowed.

### Credit Card 

Apart from the common account functionalities Credit Card accounts also have:
- A credit limit
- An interest rate applied monthly through the equation:
    - ```newBalance = oldBalance * (1 + (1/12)*interestRate)```
- Transactions that would lead to a credit greater than the limit are not allowed and, as so, the penalty fee is never applied.

### Checking

Apart from the common account functionalities Checking accounts also have:
- A minimum balance:
    - If the account balance reaches a lower value the penalty fee is applied
- A monthly maitenance fee applied monthly through the equation:
    - ```newBalance = oldBalance - montlyMaintenanceFee```
- Transactions that would lead to a negative balance are not allowed.

### Student Checking

Student Checking accounts do not have any other functionalities apart from the basic account functionalities.

## Walkthrough the Available Requests

The possible requests can be divided in terms of permissions.

### Admin Allowed Requests

#### Access Account Information

To access the balance and other informations of a particular account the Admin user may do a **get** request through the following route:
```/account/{id}``` where id is the Account's identifier, for example:
```
/account/CC_1
```
After the request the Admin user will receive a response such as:
```
{
    "id": "CC_1",
    "balance": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": -300.00
    },
    "penaltyFee": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 40.00
    },
    "creationDate": "2000-01-01",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "primaryOwnerName": "Jim Halpert",
    "secondaryOwnerName": "Pam Beesly",
    "creditLimit": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 300.00
    },
    "interestRate": 0.2000
}
```

#### Change Account Balance

To change the balance of a particular account the Admin user may do a **patch** request through the following route:
```/balance/{id}``` where id is the Account's identifier, for example:
```
/balance/CC_1
```
The Admin user must also provide the new balance in euros (€) through the request body like in the following example:
```
{
    "balance": {
        "amount": 300.00
    }
}    

```

After the request the Admin user will receive a response with the updated balance value such as:
```
{
    "id": "CC_1",
    "balance": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 300.00
    },
    "penaltyFee": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 40.00
    },
    "creationDate": "2000-01-01",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "primaryOwnerName": "Jim Halpert",
    "secondaryOwnerName": "Pam Beesly",
    "creditLimit": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 300.00
    },
    "interestRate": 0.2000
}
```
If the user provides an **invalid** value for the balance (lower than the credit limit for Credit Card accounts or negative for all other accounts) the balance will be updated with the **minimum** allowed value.

#### Create a Banking Account

To create a new banking account the Admin user may do a **post** request through the following route:
```/create/account```

The Admin user must also provide the new account information through the request body:
- accountType: Can have the values CHECKING, SAVINGS or CREDIT_CARD and defines what type of account to create,
- balance: Defines the balance value for the account, 
    - balance values lower than 0 or lower than the credit limit for Credit Card will default to the minimum allowed value,
- primaryOwnerId: Identifier of the primary Account Holder user,
- secondaryOwnerId (optional): Identifier of the secondary Account Holder user
- creditLimit: Credit limit value for a Credit Card account, 
    - it does not have any impact when creating an account other than Credit Card
    - its value is limited to the maximum of 100000€ and minimum of 100€
    - when creating a Credit Card account if this value is not provided it defaults to 100€
- minimumBalance: Minimum balance for a Savings account (Checking has a default of 250€)
    - it does not have any impact when creating an account other than Savings
    - its value is limited to the maximum of 1000€ and minimum 100€
    - when creating a Savings account if this value is not provided it defaults to 1000€
- interestRate: Interest rate value for a Credit Card or Savings account,
    - when creating a Savings account this value is limited to the maximum of 0.5 and minimum of 0
    - when creating a Savings account if this value is not provided it defaults to 0.0025
    - when creating a Credit Card account this value is limited to the maximum 0.2 and the minimum 0.1
    - when creating a Credit Card account if this value is not provided it defaults to 0.1

Example of a request body:
```
{
    "accountType": "CREDIT_CARD",
    "balance": {
        "amount": 300.00
    },
    "primaryOwnerId": 1,
    "secondaryOwnerId": 2,
    "creditLimit": {
        "amount": 50.00
    },
    "interestRate": 0.15
}    
```

After the request the Admin user will receive a response with the created account information such as:
```
{
    "id": "CC_6",
    "balance": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 300.00
    },
    "penaltyFee": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 40.00
    },
    "creationDate": "2021-09-29",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "primaryOwnerName": "Jim Halpert",
    "secondaryOwnerName": "Pam Beesly",
    "creditLimit": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 100.00
    },
    "interestRate": 0.15
}
```

### Add Third Party User to the Database

To create a new Third Party user the Admin user may do a **post** request through the following route:
```/create/third_party```

The Admin user must also provide the new Third Party user name through the request body as the following example:

Example of a request body:
```
{
    "name": "Kelly Kapoor"
}    
```

After the request the Admin user will receive a response with the created Third Party information such as:
```
{
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Kelly Kapoor"
}
```
For security reasons the hashed key is not provided in the response

### Account Holder Allowed Requests

#### Access Account Information

Similarly to an Admin, to access the balance and other informations of a particular **owned** account the Account Holder user may do a **get** request through the following route:
```/account/{id}``` where id is the Account's identifier, for example:
```
/account/CC_1
```
After the request the Account Holder user will receive a response such as:
```
{
    "id": "CC_1",
    "balance": {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "amount": 342.50
    },
    "penaltyFee": {
